[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/leaflet.locatecontrol.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/leaflet.locatecontrol)
[![jsDelivr Hits](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/leaflet.locatecontrol/badge?style=rounded)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/leaflet.locatecontrol)

A useful control to geolocate the user with many options. Official [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html#geolocation) and [MapBox plugin](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/leaflet-locatecontrol/).

Tested with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) 1.9.2 and [Mapbox.js](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/) 3.3.1 in Firefox, Chrome and Safari.

Please check for [breaking changes in the changelog](https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-locatecontrol/blob/gh-pages/CHANGELOG.md).

## Demo

Check out the [demo page](https://domoritz.github.io/leaflet-locatecontrol/) with three different examples (Leaflet UMD, Leaflet ESM, Mapbox UMD).

## Basic Usage

### Set up

1. Get the JavaScript and CSS files
2. Include the files in your project
3. Initialize the plugin

#### Get the JavaScript and CSS files

**For production:**

The best way to get the plugin is via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/):

```bash
npm install leaflet.locatecontrol
```

Alternatively, you can use the [JsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/leaflet.locatecontrol) (see instructions below) or [download the files from this repository](https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-locatecontrol/archive/gh-pages.zip).

**For development:**

Clone the repository to work with the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-locatecontrol
```

The source files are in `src/` and the built distribution files are in `dist/`.

#### Include the JavaScript and CSS files in your project

##### With CDN

In this example, we are loading the [files from the JsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/leaflet.locatecontrol?path=dist). In the URLs below, replace `[VERSION]` with the latest release number or remove `@[VERSION]` to always use the latest version.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/leaflet.locatecontrol@[VERSION]/dist/L.Control.Locate.min.css" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/leaflet.locatecontrol@[VERSION]/dist/L.Control.Locate.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

##### With `npm`

```ts
import "leaflet.locatecontrol"; // Import plugin
import "leaflet.locatecontrol/dist/L.Control.Locate.min.css"; // Import styles
import L from "leaflet"; // Import L from leaflet to start using the plugin
```

If you are using a bundler or esm, use

```ts
import { LocateControl } from "leaflet.locatecontrol";
import "leaflet.locatecontrol/dist/L.Control.Locate.min.css";
```

Then use `new LocateControl()` instead of `L.control.locate()`.

#### Add the following snippet to your map initialization

This snippet adds the control to the map. You can pass also pass a configuration.

```js
L.control.locate().addTo(map);
```

### Possible options

The locate controls inherits options from [Leaflet Controls](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control).

To customize the control, pass an object with your custom options to the locate control.

```js
L.control.locate(OPTIONS).addTo(map);
```

Possible options are listed in the following table. More details are [in the code](https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-locatecontrol/blob/gh-pages/src/L.Control.Locate.js#L118).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Option     | Type      | Description       |  Default |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| `position` | `string`  | Position of the control | `topleft` |
| `layer` | [`ILayer`](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#ilayer)  | The layer that the user's location should be drawn on. | a new layer |
| `setView` | `boolean`  or `string`  | Set the map view (zoom and pan) to the user's location as it updates. Options are `false`, `'once'`, `'always'`, `'untilPan'`, or `'untilPanOrZoom'` | `'untilPanOrZoom'` |
| `flyTo` | `boolean` | Smooth pan and zoom to the location of the marker. Only works in Leaflet 1.0+. | `false` |
| `keepCurrentZoomLevel` | `boolean` or `Array`  | Only pan when setting the view. Set to `true` to always keep the current zoom, or provide a zoom range like `[13, 18]` to only keep the zoom when it's within that range. Outside the range, the map will zoom normally. | `false` |
| `initialZoomLevel` | `false` or `integer` | After activating the plugin by clicking on the icon, zoom to the selected zoom level, even when keepCurrentZoomLevel is true. Set to `false` to disable this feature. | `false` |
| `clickBehavior` | `object`  | What to do when the user clicks on the control. Has three options `inView`, `inViewNotFollowing` and `outOfView`. Possible values are `stop` and `setView`, or the name of a behaviour to inherit from. | `{inView: 'stop', outOfView: 'setView', inViewNotFollowing: 'inView'}` |
| `returnToPrevBounds` | `boolean`  | If set, save the map bounds just before centering to the user's location. When control is disabled, set the view back to the bounds that were saved. | `false` |
| `cacheLocation` | `boolean` | Keep a cache of the location after the user deactivates the control. If set to false, the user has to wait until the locate API returns a new location before they see where they are again. | `true` |
| `showCompass` | `boolean` | Show the compass bearing on top of the location marker | `true` |
| `drawCircle` | `boolean`  | If set, a circle that shows the location accuracy is drawn. | `true` |
| `drawMarker` | `boolean`  | If set, the marker at the users' location is drawn. | `true` |
| `markerClass` | `class`  | The class to be used to create the marker. | `LocationMarker` |

| `metric` | `boolean` | Use metric units. | `true` |
| `onLocationOutsideMapBounds` | `function`  | Called when the user's location is outside the bounds set on the map. Called repeatedly when the user's location changes. | see code |
| `showPopup` | `boolean`  | Display a pop-up when the user click on the inner marker. | `true` |
| `strings` | `object`  | Strings used in the control. Options are `title`, `text`, `metersUnit`, `feetUnit`, `popup` and `outsideMapBoundsMsg` | see code |
| `strings.popup` | `string` or `function`  | The string shown as popup. May contain the placeholders `{distance}`, `{unit}`, `{lat}`, `{lng}`, and `{altitude}`. If this option is specified as function, it will be executed with a single parameter `{distance, unit, lat, lng, altitude}` and expected to return a string. | see code |
| `locateOptions` | [`Locate options`](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#locate-options)  | The default options passed to leaflets locate method. | see code |
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

For example, to customize the position and the title, you could write

```js
let lc = L.control
  .locate({
    position: "topright",
    strings: {
      title: "Show me where I am, yo!"
    }
  })
  .addTo(map);
```

To add text next to the location icon:

```js
let lc = L.control
  .locate({
    strings: {
      title: "Show me where I am, yo!",
      text: "Locate me"
    }
  })
  .addTo(map);
```

## Advanced Usage

### Methods

You can call `start()` or `stop()` on the locate control object to set the location on page load for example.

```js
// create control and add to map
let lc = L.control.locate().addTo(map);

// request location update and set location
lc.start();
```

You can keep the plugin active but stop following using `lc.stopFollowing()`.

### Events

You can leverage the native Leaflet events `locationfound` and `locationerror` to handle when geolocation is successful or produces an error. You can find out more about these events in the [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/examples/mobile/#geolocation).

Additionally, the locate control fires the following events on the map object:

| Event                 | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `locateactivate`      | Fired when the control is activated                                                                             |
| `locatedeactivate`    | Fired when the control is deactivated                                                                           |
| `locatelocationfound` | Fired when a location is found (includes `latlng`, `accuracy`, `bounds`, `control`, and other geolocation data) |
| `locationtimeout`     | Fired when geolocation timeouts occur in watch mode                                                             |

The `locatelocationfound` event is particularly useful when you need to react to location updates with access to the control instance. For example, to get the location once and then stop:

```js
map.on("locatelocationfound", function (e) {
  console.log("Location found:", e.latlng);
  console.log("Accuracy:", e.accuracy, "meters");
  e.control.stop(); // Stop after first location ("one-shot" behavior)
});
```

The `locationtimeout` event is useful when geolocation timeouts occur in watch mode. This is useful for providing custom feedback to users when location acquisition takes longer than expected:

```js
map.on("locationtimeout", function (e) {
  console.log("Location timeout count:", e.count);
  // Provide custom feedback or retry logic
});
```

Note: When `watch: true` (the default), timeout errors don't stop the location tracking - the browser will automatically retry. After 3 consecutive timeouts, the control displays a visual indicator (orange spinner) to inform users that location acquisition is taking longer than usual.

### Extending

To customize the behavior of the plugin, use L.extend to override `start`, `stop`, `_drawMarker` and/or `_removeMarker`. Please be aware that functions may change and customizations become incompatible.

```js
L.Control.MyLocate = L.Control.Locate.extend({
  _drawMarker: function () {
    // override to customize the marker
  }
});

let lc = new L.Control.MyLocate();
```

### FAQ

#### How do I set the maximum zoom level?

Set the `maxZoom` in `locateOptions` (only applies when `keepCurrentZoomLevel` is `false` or when the current zoom is outside a specified range).

```js
map.addControl(
  L.control.locate({
    locateOptions: {
      maxZoom: 10
    }
  })
);
```

You can also use `keepCurrentZoomLevel: [13, 18]` to only keep zoom when it's between levels 13-18, but zoom normally outside that range:

```js
map.addControl(
  L.control.locate({
    keepCurrentZoomLevel: [13, 18],
    locateOptions: {
      maxZoom: 16
    }
  })
);
```

#### How do I enable high accuracy?

To enable [high accuracy (GPS) mode](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#locate-options-enablehighaccuracy), set the `enableHighAccuracy` in `locateOptions`.

```js
map.addControl(
  L.control.locate({
    locateOptions: {
      enableHighAccuracy: true
    }
  })
);
```

#### Safari does not work with Leaflet 1.7.1

This is a bug in Leaflet. Disable tap to fix it for now. See [this issue](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/7255) for details.

```js
let map = new L.Map('map', {
    tap: false,
    ...
});
```

## Developers

Run the demo locally with `npm start` and then open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

The development server is a native Node.js script (`scripts/server.js`) that serves the project on port 9000. It does not require any external dependencies. Note that modern browsers treat `localhost` as a secure context, so HTTPS is not required for the Geolocation API to work.

To generate the minified JS and CSS files, run `npm run build`.

## Prettify and linting

Before a Pull Request please check the code style.

Run `npm run lint` to check if there are code style or linting issues.

Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix style and linting issues.

## Making a release (only core developer)

A new version is released with `npm run bump:minor` or `npm run bump:patch`. Then push the changes with `git push && git push --tags` and publish to npm with `npm publish`.

### Terms

- **active**: After we called `map.locate()` and before `map.stopLocate()`. Any time, the map can fire the `locationfound` or `locationerror` events.
- **following**: Following refers to whether the map zooms and pans automatically when a new location is found.
